Notes on [What's a module system good for anyway?](http://blog.ezyang.com/2014/08/whats-a-module-system-good-for-anyway/)

#### 1. A simple problem: Too many text encodings

- String
- ByteString (Strict/Lazy)
- Text (Strict/Lazy)

See [this reddit comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/28v6c9/backpack_an_mllike_module_system_for_haskell/cif36ed) for an explanation of how to fix this. Basic idea: import `String` and decide upon a concrete representation later on.

#### 2. Destructive package installs

Example: 

```
$ cabal install hakyll
cabal: The following packages are likely to be broken by the reinstalls:
pandoc-1.9.4.5
Graphalyze-0.14.0.0
Use --force-reinstalls if you want to install anyway.
```

Main idea: pandoc, Graphalyze might have been compiled against a version of some dependency of hakyll that is incompatible with hakyll; need to reinstall everything in order to get this to work. Cabal only allows a single version of a given package to be installed at any point.

#### 3. Version Bounds

Example:

```
$ cabal install hledger-0.18
Resolving dependencies...
cabal: Could not resolve dependencies:
# pile of output
```

Version bounds are important, but sometimes this happens because the constraints on dependencies is undecideable (usually due to upper bounds, which are arbitrary a lot of the time). Cabal even has the flag `--allow-newer` to avoid this!

Idea for a fix: Instead of having versions and dependencies, generate a "module signature" which can be interpreted by the compiler to install the proper dependencies.
