Notes on [the category design pattern](http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/08/the-category-design-pattern.html)

Functional programming $\subset$ "Compositional programming"

Category theory provides laws that present a rigorous criteria for what "compositional" really means.

Category Theory: A different introduction (composition is the most important piece we care about)

For all Categories, there must exist a composition operator $\circ$.

Category laws:

- Associative law: $(f \circ g) \circ h = h \circ (g \circ h)$
- Left identity: $1 \circ f = f$
- Right identity: $f \circ 1 = 1$

Try to formulate abstractions in this way whenever possible, because it leads to intuitive, easy-to-use, edge-case-free behavior.

Haskell functions form a category:

$$1 = id \\ \circ = (.)$$

Can easily prove the category laws through their definitions.

The Kleisli category

```haskell
return :: Monad m => a -> m a
(<=<) :: Monad m => (b -> m c) -> (a -> m b) -> a -> m c
```

$$ 1 = return \\ \circ = (<=<) $$

It's pretty clear how these relate to normal functions; note that the implementation for `<=<` is this, which looks an awful lot like the implementation for `.`:

```haskell
(f <=< g) x = f =<< (g x)
```

The category laws for the Kleisli category can be derived the same as the Monad laws and vice versa; they're the same.

An interesting tidbit:

```haskell
spawn      ::  IO a  -> IO (IO a)
mapM spawn :: [IO a] -> IO [IO a]
sequence   :: [IO a] -> IO    [a]

concurrentSequence :: [IO a] -> IO [a]
concurrentSequence = sequence <=< mapM spawn
```

The category of Pipes

$$ 1 = cat \\ \circ = (<-<) $$

```haskell
data Pipe a b r
  = Pure r
  | Await (a -> Pipe a b r)
  | Yield b (Pipe a b r)

(<-<) :: Pipe b c r -> Pipe a b r -> Pipe a c r
Pure    r  <-< _          = Pure r
Yield b p1 <-< p2         = Yield b (p1 <-< p2)
Await   f  <-< Yield b p2 = f b <-< p2
p1         <-< Await   f  = Await $ \a -> p1 <-< f a
_          <-< Pure    r  = Pure r

cat   :: Pipe a a r
cat = Await $ \a -> Yield a cat
```

Category laws (Prove as an exercise):

```haskell
cat <-< p = p                           -- Right identity
p <-< cat = p                           -- Left  identity
(p1 <-< p2) <-< p3 = p1 <-< (p2 <-< p3) -- Associativity
```

In conclusion:

Composition is great. Define it and use it, as long as it obeys the category laws.
