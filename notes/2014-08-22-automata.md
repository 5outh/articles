Notes on [Demand More of Your Automata from the Monad Reader 16](http://themonadreader.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/issue16.pdf).

Intro: We want to match on more than just strings, and in a way that actually makes sense instead of stuff like

```js
(?P<area>\d{3})[- .](?P<n1>\d{3})[-.](?P<n2>\d{4})
```

Regexes might "match" a string.

Three operations:

- Glue two regexes together
- Match $r_1$ OR $r_2$ for regexes $r_i$
- Match a regex zero or more times (Kleene closure)

```haskell
data RegularExpression
    = Empty
    | Singleton Char
    | Kleene RegularExpression
    | Catenation RegularExpression RegularExpression
    | Alternation RegularExpression RegularExpression
```

for `(ab)*c|d`, we have syntax mapping:

1. `Singleton 'a'` $\mapsto$ `a`
2. `Kleene (...)` $\mapsto$ `(...)*`
3. `Catenation (Singleton 'a') (Singleton 'b')` $\mapsto$ `ab`
4. `Alteration (Singleton 'a') (Singleton 'b')` $\mapsto$ `a|b`

True regexes guarantee that everything can happen in one pass of the input. Regex matchers usually implemented in NDAs or DFAs (*only* powerful enough to match regular languages).

Overview: DFA, NFA in text.

Haskell representations:

```haskell
-- Assume "type State = Int" or something like that.
-- transition returns Nothing if in "error state" (w/ no transitions)
data DFA
    = DFA { transition :: State -> Char -> Maybe State
          , start      :: State
          , accepting  :: State -> Bool
          }
data NFA
    = NFA { transition :: State -> Maybe Char -> Set State
          , start      :: State
          , accepting  :: State -> Bool
          }
```

In NFAs, $\epsilon$ transitions are represented by `Nothing`.

Why just `[Char]`? We can do better!

```haskell
data RegularExpression a
    = Empty
    | Singleton a
    | Kleene (RegularExpression a)
    | Catenation (RegularExpression a) (RegularExpression a)
    | Alternation (RegularExpression a) (RegularExpression a)
    deriving (Show, Functor)
```

A way to make NFAs directly:

```haskell
type StateLabel = Int
type MapNFATransitionMap a
    = Map.Map (StateLabel, Maybe a) (Set.Set StateLabel)
data MapNFA a = MapNFA { transitionMap :: MapNFATransitionMap a
                       , startKey :: StateLabel
                       , acceptKeys :: Set.Set StateLabel
                       } deriving (Show
```

```haskell
empty :: Ord a => MapNFA a
singleton :: Ord a => a -> MapNFA a
catenate :: Ord a => MapNFA a -> MapNFA a -> MapNFA a
alternate :: Ord a => MapNFA a -> MapNFA a -> MapNFA a
loop :: Ord a => MapNFA a -> MapNFA a
```

We implement `loop` here instead of `kleene`, which can be represented as `kleene = optional . loop where `optional = alternate empty`.

The rest of the article is about HOFs for abstracting away regex design, visualizing with GraphViz, compiling to LLVM.

I skimmed through the rest of it, because it's the Friday of my first week back at school and I'm tired. It looks like the final implementation of the `Automata` library isn't on hackage or github, and the link is broken. :(

Revisit this one later, it's pretty cool. One of the non-string matching regexes was about matching lists of user actions (clicking, typing, following a link). Neat.
